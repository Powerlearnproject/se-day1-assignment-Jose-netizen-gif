#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- It is a discipline that applies engineering principles to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of computer software.
 -Importance-It enables technology development and innovations.
 Enables digital transformations in industries hence reliability and more efficiency in operations.
 Enables data security and protection to sensitive data and information preventing breaching 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

-Mastering complexity-Early software was relatively simple for increasingly complex tasks hence need for breaking complex tasks to simple and managable tasks hence creating tools and methodologies for operation.
-Mastering process-This was mainly on project management as software projects grew larger and larger. This needed good and key project developments, waterfall model and agile methodologies were developed.
-Mastering machine-involves understanding both the principles of ML and the specific challenges of software development and maintenance. 

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning:
This initial phase focuses on defining the project's scope, goals, and feasibility
Requirements Analysis:
This phase involves gathering and documenting the detailed requirements of the software.
Design:
In this phase, the software's architecture and design are created.
Implementation (Coding):
This is where the actual coding of the software takes place.
Testing:
This phase focuses on identifying and fixing any defects or bugs in the software.
Deployment:
In this phase, the software is released and made available to the users.
Maintenance:
This ongoing phase involves providing support and making necessary updates to the software after it has been deployed.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

-Waterfall methodology - Linear and sequential, each phase is completed before moving on. 
there is Low flexibility,
changes are hard to incorporate once a phase is complete.
Customer feedback comes late, after the product is developed.
Testing is done at the end of the development process.
-Agile Methodology-Iterative and incremental: Development occurs in short cycles called "sprints."   
Flexible and adaptable: Embraces changes and feedback throughout the development process.   
Emphasis on collaboration: Encourages close collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and customers.   
Focus on working software: Prioritizes delivering working software over comprehensive documentation.

   
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-Software Developer - developing applications,programs and systems using programming languages and frameworks.
Writing and maintaining code:
Designing software solutions
Debugging and troubleshooting 
Code reviews
Collaboration

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

-Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) are indispensable tools in modern software development. They significantly enhance productivity, collaboration, and code quality. 
Importance
Increased Productivity: IDEs provide a centralized environment for writing, testing, and debugging code, reducing the need to switch between multiple tools.   
Code Completion and Suggestions: Features like auto-completion and code suggestions speed up development and reduce errors.   
Debugging Tools: Built-in debuggers allow developers to easily identify and fix bugs.   
Code Navigation: IDEs make it easy to navigate through large codebases, improving code understanding and maintainability.   
Integration with Other Tools: IDEs often integrate with VCS, testing frameworks, and other development tools.   
Syntax Highlighting: This feature makes code more readable and helps to identify syntax errors.
Examples: Visual Studio (Microsoft), Android Studio (Google)

-Version Control Systems (VCS) - are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. eg Git
Collaboration: VCS enables multiple developers to work on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts.   
Tracking Changes: VCS maintains a history of all code changes, allowing developers to revert to previous versions if needed.   
Branching and Merging: VCS allows developers to create branches for new features or bug fixes, and then merge them back into the main codebase.   
Code Backup: VCS provides a backup of the codebase, protecting against data loss.   
Auditing: VCS provides an audit trail of changes, which is useful for tracking down bugs and understanding code evolution.   
Release Management: VCS helps manage releases by tagging specific versions of the codebase.   
Examples:
Git: A distributed version control system that is widely used in modern software development.
Github, Gitlab

 What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

1. Dealing with Technical Debt:
Challenge: Accumulated technical debt (shortcuts, poor design decisions) can slow down development and increase maintenance costs.   
Strategies:
Prioritize Refactoring: Allocate time for regular refactoring to improve code quality.   
Implement Code Reviews: Identify and address potential technical debt early in the development process.   
Use Static Analysis Tools: Detect code smells and potential issues automatically.   
Document Technical debt: keep track of the debt, and plan to pay it down.   
2. Managing Complexity:

Challenge: Large and complex software systems can be difficult to understand and maintain.   
Strategies:
Modular Design: Break down systems into smaller, manageable modules.   
Design Patterns: Utilize established design patterns to create maintainable and scalable code.

Automated Testing: Implement automated tests to ensure that changes do not introduce new bugs.
Code Documentation: Document legacy code to improve understanding.   
Reverse Engineering: if documentation is very poor, attempt to reverse engineer the code to understand its purpose.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests - are close to the source of an application, They consist in testing individual methods and functions of the classes, components, or modules used by your software. - it ensures that each unit performs its intended function correctly, isolated from other components.
 Integration tests - verify that different modules or services used by your application work well together.
 - help to ensure data flows smoothly between modules and interfaces work as expected.
 System testing -Focus on the entire software system as a whole, including all functionalities and interactions.
 -It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security .
Acceptance tests - are formal tests that verify if a system satisfies business requirements. They require the entire application to be running while testing and focus on replicating user behaviors. 
- Whether the software meets the needs of the end-user and is ready for deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

 prompt engineering  is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired outputs.
Importance:
Improved user experience - Prompt engineering makes it easy for users to obtain relevant results in the first prompt. It helps mitigate bias that may be present from existing human bias in the large language models’ training data.
Increased flexibility - A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns.
developer control - Prompt engineering gives developers more control over users' interactions with the AI. Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models. Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Draw a picture of a person
Draw a full-body portrait of a young woman with long brown hair, wearing a red jacket and blue jeans, standing in a park on a sunny day with trees and grass in the background.
Clarity: The improved prompt specifies what is being asked (a full-body portrait) rather than just a "person.
Specific Details: Describing the woman's appearance (long brown hair, red jacket, blue jeans) and the setting (park, sunny day, trees, grass) gives clear guidance on the image to be created.
Concise: The additional details provide a clear picture without being overly complicated, making it easier for the artist to understand exactly what is needed.
